# Ground truth on number of sets:
# Direction.FORWARD
# n = 1: 8
# n = 2: 73
# n = 3: 955 (barely computable via brute force)

# Direction.BACKWARD
# n = 1: 7
# n = 2: 67
# n = 3: 771

# tricky sets
# Direction.FORWARD
# t is the twenty-eighth, seventeenth letter

# Direction.BACKWARD
# t is the thirty seventh, third letter
