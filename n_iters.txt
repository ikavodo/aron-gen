# Ground truth for number of sets per iteration:
# Direction.FORWARD
# n = 1: 8
# n = 2: 73
# n = 3: 955 (barely computable via brute force)

# Direction.BACKWARD
# n = 1: 7
# n = 2: 67
# n = 3: 771

# sequences not found by forward_fix() when range is too small

#  T is the twenty-fifth, first letter in this sentence, not counting commas and spaces
#  T is the twenty-seventh, first letter in this sentence, not counting commas and spaces
#  T is the twenty-sixth, first letter in this sentence, not counting commas and spaces
#  T is the twentieth, fourth letter in this sentence, not counting commas and spaces
#  T is the twenty-eighth, fourth letter in this sentence, not counting commas and spaces
